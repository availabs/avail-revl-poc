# The Event Emitter

This module and its interface will change completely.

It currently tries to replicate REDUX, which is not a good idea.

The goal it to make this entire system
[Event-Driven](https://martinfowler.com/articles/201701-event-driven.html),
and this a legitimate [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) server
